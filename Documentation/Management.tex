\par \vspace{0.25cm}The coding of each interfaces is divided into a few phases due to the interface is constantly being optimized according to the client's demand. As our interface needed to be confirmed during every meeting, we spend our time on documentation and report during the interval between each meeting. 

\par \vspace{0.25cm}The transmission code is not given until our interfaces are finalized. Due to that, the integration phase was shifted to a later date. But it doesn't took a long time to integrate with the interface, so we focused on our report when we have finished our tasks. The client gave use the executable file rather than the source code. It makes our task easier because we do not need to program them but it makes us very dependent to our client's code which affected our schedule a lot.
